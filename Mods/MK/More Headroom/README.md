# More Headroom

I needed a bit more headroom above the toolhead for routing my cables without them touching the top panel.

This mod allows you to mount an extra layer of 1515 extrusions on top of the existing ones while reusing all the panels.

The 1515 extrusion screw right into the existing ones so you get a solid construction while adding 15mm of headroom.

## Instructions

1) Print 4 corner blocks and 4 panel clips
2) Use 2x M3 BHCS (6 or 8mm) per corner to create a square with 4 extrusions
3) Screw the extra layer with 4 more bolts onto your printer
4) Mount the panel clips
