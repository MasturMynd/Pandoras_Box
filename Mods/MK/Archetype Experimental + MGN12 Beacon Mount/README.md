# Archetype Experimental + Extrusionless MGN12 Beacon Mount

The standard beacon mount from Archetype would collide with the AB mounts when doing sensorless homing.

This mount moves beacon a bit closer towards the hotend (which is also recommended by Beacon's instructions) so that it will not collide with the motor mounts resulting in a bit more Y-travel and no worries when doing sensorless homing.

Tested and working with Phaetus Dragon UHF hotend.

## Instructions

1) Print with 6 walls
2) Remove the two small support parts included in the STL
3) Insert 2 heat inserts
4) Screw the mount to your carriage with m3 BHCS or SHCS
5) Screw beacon to the mount into the heat inserts with m3 low profile or BHCS
